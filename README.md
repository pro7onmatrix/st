# st - simple terminal
My fork of the [st](https://st.suckless.org/) terminal emulator
by suckless, including the [Nord color scheme](https://www.nordtheme.com/),
background transparency, and some other modifications. Scrollback is handled
using the suckless [scroll](https://tools.suckless.org/scroll/) program, although
this is still in early development and struggles a bit in zsh when scrolling up
and then back down again.
